## Cyberpunk 2020 Character Generator

### What is this? 
A character generator for the [Cyberpunk 2020 Role Playing Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020). 

Cyberpunk 2020 was a game I played back in high school. I remember the character generation process taking a long time because the player had to roll a 10 sided dice over and over to determine things like attributes, skills, strengths and weaknesses, life events, etc. This is a tool I would have created at that time if I had programming knowledge.
