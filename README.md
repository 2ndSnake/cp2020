### What is this? Why?
Cyberpunk 2020 was a game I played in high school. I remember the character generation process taking a long time because the player had to roll a 10 sided dice over and over to determine things like his characters skills, strengths and weaknesses, and history. Back then, I always wanted something like this character creator to save time and get right to the gaming portion. Essentially this is a tool I would have built if I knew Javascript and PHP in high school.
