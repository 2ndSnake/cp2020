## Cyberpunk 2020 Character Generator


For the [Cyberpunk 2020 Role Playing Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020). 



### What is this? 
Cyberpunk 2020 was a game I played in high school. I remember the character generation process taking a long time because the player had to roll a 10 sided dice over and over to determine things like his characters skills, strengths and weaknesses, and history. 

Back then, I always wanted something like this character creator to save time. This is a tool I would have built if I knew Javascript and PHP in high school.
